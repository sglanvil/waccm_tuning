# waccm_tuning

Repo for routine/unremarkable WACCM tuning runs. 

More noteworthy tuning runs will be added here: https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev (or in our WAWG's own repo?)

Each simulation ("tuning run") is a github "issue" and these can be sorted by labels ("2deg", "1deg", etc.).

Discussions can take place in a thread at the bottom of each "issue".
